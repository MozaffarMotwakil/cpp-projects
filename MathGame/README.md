# MathGame

## 📌 Overview
MathGame is an interactive console-based math quiz game where players can customize their quiz settings and test their arithmetic skills. The game dynamically generates math problems based on user preferences and provides instant feedback with color-coded responses.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. The player selects the number of questions to answer.
2. The player chooses the type of arithmetic operation:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)

3. The player selects the difficulty level:
   - Easy
   - Medium
   - Hard
   - Mix (Random difficulty for each question)
4. The quiz begins, and the player answers each question.
5. If the answer is correct, the console background turns **green**.
6. If the answer is incorrect, the console background turns **red**, and the correct answer is displayed.
7. After completing all questions, the final score is displayed, including:
   - Total correct answers
   - Total incorrect answers
   - Total questions answered
   - Difficulty level
   - Arithmetic operation type
8. Based on the final score:
   - The screen turns **green** if the player passes.
   - The screen turns **red** if the player fails.
9. The player is asked if they want to take another quiz:
   - If **yes**, the console is cleared, and a new quiz starts.
