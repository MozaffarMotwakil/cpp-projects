## 📌 **How to Play?**  
1️⃣ The program asks the user to enter the **number of rounds** they want to play.  
2️⃣ In each round, the user chooses between: **Rock / Paper / Scissors**.  
3️⃣ The computer selects a **random choice**.  
4️⃣ The winner of each round is determined, and the console color changes accordingly:  
   - ✅ **Green:** If the user wins the round.  
   - ❌ **Red:** If the computer wins the round.  
   - 🟡 **Yellow:** If it's a tie.

5️⃣ After all rounds are completed, the **final result** is displayed, and the console color changes based on the overall winner:

   - ❌ **Red:** If the computer wins the most rounds.  
   - 🟡 **Yellow:** If it's a tie.
